According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun.

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

even after congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records  according to an annual report issued on tuesday by the top u s  intelligence officer  the report from the office of director of national intelligence dan coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 usa freedom act  which limited the nsa to collecting phone records and contacts of people u s  and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism  it found that the nsa collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016  in addition to a handful identified the previous year      the nsa has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone  metadata   records of callers  and recipients  phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls   but not their content   since the september 11  2001  attacks  the report came as congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  fisa   which permits the nsa to collect foreign intelligence information on non u s  persons outside the united states  and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year  privacy advocates have argued that section 702 permits the nsa to spy on internet and telephone communications of americans without warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court  and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements  the report said that on one occasion in 2016  the fbi obtained information about an american in response to a search of section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence   the report did not address how frequently the fbi obtained information about americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter  however  on friday  the nsa said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant      the new report also came amid allegations  recently repeated by u s  president donald trump  that former president barack obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser susan rice asked the nsa to unmask the names of u s  persons caught in the surveillance  both republican and democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation  officials on tuesday argued that the 151 million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former nsa contractor edward snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013  because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers  the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller  the officials said  they said they had no breakdown of how many individuals  phone records were among those collected   in all  according to the report  u s  officials unmasked the names of fewer americans in nsa eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year  the top u s  intelligence officer reported on tuesday  the report said the names of 1 934  u s  persons  were  unmasked  last year in response to specific requests  compared with 2 232 in 2015  but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds  officials said in the report that u s  intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about u s  electronic eavesdropping   this year s report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency  providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law   said office of the director of national intelligence spokesman timothy barrett  \",\n          \"washington  reuters    banks  credit card issuers and other financial companies will be able to block customers from banding together to sue over disputes  after the u s  senate on tuesday narrowly killed a rule banning the firms from using  forced arbitration  clauses  republican vice president mike pence appeared on the senate floor at 10 11 p m  edt  0211 gmt  to cast the tie breaking vote as the chamber s president and approve the most significant roll back of obama era financial policy since president donald trump took office vowing to loosen the leash on wall street  the final count was 51 to 50    the republican dominated house of representatives has already passed the resolution repealing the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb  rule released in july  the resolution also bars regulators from instituting a similar ban in the future  after a signature from trump  expected soon  the resolution will abruptly end a years long fight that has included multiple federal regulators  consumer advocacy groups  and financial lobbyists  cfpb director richard cordray  a democrat appointed by former president barack obama  rarely comments on congressional action but on tuesday night said  wall street won and ordinary people lost     this vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company   he added  customers must agree to the clauses as a condition of opening accounts  saying they will take any disputes to closed door arbitration instead of joining class action lawsuits  where complainants band together to share litigation costs  the clauses are used for nearly every u s  consumer product and service since the supreme court ruled them legal in 2011   victims of the equifax inc   efx n  hack were outraged last month when the company included forced arbitration fine print in offering them free credit monitoring  the company later removed the clauses  at the same time  wells fargo   co  wfc n  customers whose identities were used in last year s phony accounts scandal have had difficulty suing the bank because they are bound by arbitration clauses in contracts they signed for legitimate accounts  the cfpb rule  set to go into effect next spring  was not retroactive and would not have helped equifax or wells customers  members of trump s administration have relentlessly assailed the regulation  and on monday the treasury department laid out arguments against it in a special report  acting comptroller of the currency keith norieka said on tuesday the senate s action stopped a rule  that would have likely increased the cost of credit for hardworking americans and made it more difficult for small community banks to resolve differences with their customers   meanwhile  major bank lobbying groups who sued last month to block the rule cheered the resolution s passage   one of the groups  the u s  chamber of commerce  said congress had reined in the  overgrown and unaccountable  cfpb  an independent agency created to protect individuals  finances that conservatives say consistently reaches beyond its authority in its rulemaking  critics of the rule had said class actions only benefit trial lawyers and arbitration generally wins larger settlement awards for customers  supporters said forced arbitration harms customers by putting companies in control of the process and taking away the right to sue enshrined in the u s  constitution   the cfpb created its rule after conducting a five year study that found customers struggle to have banks open arbitration cases about their complaints  but that those few cases have led to slightly higher individual awards than class actions    the senate today prevented a cash grab that would have transferred wealth from consumers to the pockets of wealthy attorneys   said ted frank  director of the center for class action fairness at the free market group competitive enterprise institute  ohio senator sherrod brown  the most senior democrat on the banking committee  meanwhile  said tuesday s vote  will make the rich richer  and the powerful more powerful    \",\n          \"the popular christian author eric metaxas really puts things in perspective when he explains why sitting home in this election is not an option this question should hardly require an essay  but let s face it  we re living in strange times  america is in trouble over this past year many of donald trump s comments have made me almost literally hopping mad  the hot mic comments from 2005 are especially horrifying  can there be any question we should denounce them with flailing arms and screeching volume  i must not hang out in the right locker rooms  because if anyone i know said such things i might assault him physically  and repent later   so yes  many see these comments as a deal breaker but we have a very knotty and larger problem  what if the other candidate also has deal breakers  even a whole deplorable basketful  suddenly things become horribly awkward  would god want me simply not to vote  is that a serious option what if not pulling the lever for mr  trump effectively means electing someone who has actively enabled sexual predation in her husband before and while he was president  won t god hold me responsible for that  what if she defended a man who raped a 12 year old and in recalling the case laughed about getting away with it  will i be excused from letting this person become president  what if she used her position as secretary of state to funnel hundreds of millions into her own foundation  much of it from nations that treat women and gay people worse than dogs  since these things are true  can i escape responsibility for them by simply not voting many say they won t vote because choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil  but this is sophistry  neither candidate is pure evil  they are human beings  we cannot escape the uncomfortable obligation to soberly choose between them  not voting or voting for a third candidate who cannot win is a rationalization designed more than anything to assuage our consciences  yet people in america and abroad depend on voters to make this very difficult choice children in the middle east are forced to watch their fathers drowned in cages by isis  kids in inner city america are condemned to lives of poverty  hopelessness and increasing violence  shall we sit on our hands and simply trust  the least of these  to god  as though that were our only option  don t we have an obligation to them for many of us  this is very painful  pulling the lever for someone many think odious  but please consider this  a vote for donald trump is not necessarily a vote for donald trump himself  it is a vote for those who will be affected by the

cases  which were consolidated in federal court  all argued that the privacy rights of non yahoo users  who  did not consent to yahoo s interception and scanning of their emails   were being violated by a multi billion dollar company now  lawyers representing the plaintiffs are singing a different tune  last week  they asked us district judge lucy koh to accept a proposed settlement  pdf   under the proposal  the massive class of non yahoo users won t get any payment  but the class lawyers at girard gibbs and kaplan fox intend to ask for up to  4 million in fees   the ultimate amount of fees will be up to the judge  but yahoo has agreed not to oppose any fee request up to  4 million  while users won t get any payment  yahoo will change how it handles user e mails but it isn t the change that the plaintiffs attorneys were originally asking for  yahoo won t stop scanning e mails  instead  the company has agreed to make a technical change to when it scans e mails  in the settlement  pdf   yahoo has agreed that e mail content will be  only sent to servers for analysis for advertising purposes after a yahoo mail user can access the email in his or her inbox  the settlement deal looks

currently being held on iran s farsi island in the persian gulf  a total of 10 u s  navy personnel  nine men and one woman  have been detained by iranian authorities  navy strayed  u s  navy patrol boat in the persian gulf  image source  usni according to the pentagon  the initial narrative is as follows  the sailors were on a training mission around noon et when their boat experienced mechanical difficulty and drifted into iranian claimed waters and were detained by the iranian coast guard  officials added  the story has since been slightly revised by white house spokesman josh earnest to follow this narrative the 2 boats were traveling en route from kuwait to bahrain  when they were stopped and detained by the iranians according to usni  search and rescue teams from the harry s  truman strike group were scrambled to aid the crew but stopped short after the crew was taken by the iranians  we have been in contact with iran and have received assurances that the crew and the vessels will be returned promptly   pentagon spokesman peter cook told ap  according to persian gulf tv  farsi island is one of the iranian islands in the persian gulf  bushehr province of iran  there is an irgc navy base on this island  the island has an area of about 0 25 km  and is completely restricted to public  due to top secret governmental activities  according to nbc news  u s  state department is in touch with tehran officials and the iranians recognize that the u s  navy straying off course was a mistake  and that the sailors will be released  within hours   war inc  cnn s wolf blitzer wasted no time in ramping up talk of military tension with israeli financed neocon senator tom cotton neocon stuntalready  the u s  media  including cnn and fox  are running with the talking point that   this could not have come at a worse time for president obama right before tonight s state of union speech  when he s trying to prove to the american people that iran is a country that can be trusted to implement the historic nuclear deal  this latest naval  controversy  also comes days before the implementation phase of the iran nuclear deal  to say this is a coincidence might be naive that said  could gop and israel aligned members of the pentagon or intelligence establishment have helped to engineer today s bizarre  mini crisis  in order to help weaken u s  iran relations  and by extension  obama s controversial iranian nuclear deal this looks likely to be the case  as evidenced by the quick appearance of the israel lobby sponsored  pro war u s  senator tom cotton  r   placed by cnn to direct aggressive u s  military talking points live on air as the story broke today  cotton  photo  left  immediately called the event  hostile  and blamed iran for the u s  boat drifting into iranian waters  and then blamed the  crisis  on president obama  who he claims   has emboldened the iranian aggression  cotton then goes on to tell a giant lie  on which his media handler  cnn s wolf blitzer  does not even blink  much less challenge cotton s imaginary statement  the iranians  who are largely responsible for killing our  american  soldiers in iraq and afghanistan  cotton then went on to threaten iran  saying that  these sailors and both vessels  need to be immediately released  if they are not released  then the iran  nuclear  deal should not go forward  and military force will be on the table to retaliate for this act of aggression   cotton then proceeded to give a veiled  nuclear   threat to iran  saying that   all  military  options should be on the table   would washington s top operatives go so far as to engineer or exacerbate an international crisis such as this   by dispatching the boats off course  knowing full well that iran would not harm u s  personnel  but using the incident to injure a lame duck  the answer is  yes   and they ve done it before in 1979  52 american diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days in what became known as the iranian hostage crisis  which just happened to take place during a us presidential election cycle  with then president jimmy carter  d  running for reelection against challenger ronald reagan  r   the crisis  including a horrific failed rescue attempt  was used against carter in the media  according to reports at the time reagan campaign operatives had managed to do a backdoor deal with the elements of the new iranian regime to  hold off  releasing the hostages until after the election  in the end  reagan won and took credit for that  victory  not surprisingly  at the end of his prearranged cnn segment  cotton invoked the  feckless foreign policy  of jimmy carter which  caused  the 1979 iran hostage crisis  and compared that to president obama s current policy of all the u s  officials cnn could have brought in on  short notice   they chose senator tom cotton  the most hawkish and closest aligned to israel  clearly  this looks like a neocon stunt stay tuned for more

reliable non jihadist  moderate  rebels hanging out in turkey and jordan  who might want to fight for washington in syria  after all the drama over its infamous  train and equip  program to create their own arab army in syria  they want to give it another try this week  pentagon officials announced their new plan to train up to 7 000 more  moderate  fighters  but this time the project would take place inside syria  and to hell with international law  we re told that this was requested by ankara  and with all nato allies singing the same hymn   claiming that this new effort will help in securing turkey s porous border with syria  or so the story goes  washington s political cover for this is fashioned from the popular post paris theme  to protect civilized europe from invading hordes and the terrorists who hide among them  as stated in the wall street journal  the program would address part of the tense and long running dialogue between washington and ankara over sealing the border  which western governments have long complained is an avenue for extremists to leave syria and travel internationally  the timing of this announcement seemed uncanny against the backdrop of an unlikely isis  suicide bomb  terrorist attack  in turkey  of all places  where the victims just happened to be 14 german tourists  feeding perfectly into europe s new binary fear set of terrorism and immigration  shades of gladio  undoubtedly  but you won t see western journalists entertaining such conspiracy theories  our friends at nation builders inc are banking on the global public suffering from syria fatigue  but now is the time to really pay attention  the west s real agenda for the region is starting to unfold despite all of us led coalition s scandals  lies  epic failures  false flags and official conspiracy theories  the mainstream narrative on syria persists  it s on our tv screens and in our newspapers constantly   from los angeles to london  from paris to riyadh  every politician and pundit seems to have an opinion about   what to do with syria   everyone  except the syria people  themselves  who like the people of iraq  libya  afghanistan  yemen and ever other country that s found itself under the cleaver of western interests   are never afforded any say in their own destiny  as is tradition in washington  london and paris  the only syrian voices which count are the ones who have been hand picked by western technocrats and approved by the saudi royal family to form their ever changing  recognized  government in exile  the syrian national council  currently  that could be riad hijab   george sabra or khaled khoja  next week  it could be three others  depending on who has fallen in  or out of favor with washington or riyadh to anyone who was listening close enough early on in the conflict  you would have heard determined members of the western backed  syrian opposition  admitting how they would   make a deal with the devil if that s what it takes to win power   four years later  we now see that is exactly what happened  but whether you believe that this  devil is us led coalition  or terrorist armies fighting groups  or both  might be cause for debate  others will argue over which is the bigger devil   is it the wahabist salafist terrorist brigades like al nusra front and islamic state  or is it the west and its gcc partners the unfortunate reality is that these two devils are not mutually exclusive  the west and its partners not only created this  terror  crisis  but did so with the intent of unveiling a grand  solution  to the problem plans a zthe terrorist enclave in syria is designed for purpose   to implant a hostile metastasis right in the middle of the very territory which neocolonial powers plan to tear away from the barely sovereign nations of iraq and syria since 2011  the western led cartel has deployed various levels of international subterfuge in syria  starting with plan a  the arab spring method   igniting a popular street uprising that might capture the world s attention for 15 minutes   enough to generate some high quality evocative imagery and a social media storm to carry memes of liberty around the globe  inspiring the people on the streets  and on twitter  to demand  change   their cries for freedom would then be backed up by the us state department  along with its functionaries at human rights watch and amnesty international america  and other open society institute funded ngos and  human rights  organizations  obviously  this did not work  next  plan b  the political opposition suddenly transcended into an armed  paramilitary opposition  followed by brutal violence and killing on both sides  the us and its allies wasted no time  pledging weapons  training  cash and logistical support to the armed opposition  the west set up its own parallel government for syria abroad  but it failed to gain any traction with the syria people  then came plan c  this  opposition  would be quickly overrun and absorbed into a massive array of mostly foreign jihadi and mercenary soldiers of misfortune and other assorted terrorists  this fed into an already established  war on terror  western narrative  now the west had a familiar entry point into the fight  the washington london paris tel aviv riyadh doha ankara axis hoped that these terrorists would do the job of overthrowing the government of bashar al assad in damascus  and collapse the country into a spirally pit of sectarian and tribal chaos  who could blame them  after all  it worked in libya in late 2011 fast forward to 2016  having failed to overthrow assad and implode the nation state of syria  the men and women of nation builders inc and their muscles in brussels  nato   are quickly moving to plan d  take territory  that s not to say plans a through d weren t always in the schematics   they certainly were  and further back than many people would dare to speculate we now know from wikileaks cables that this operation goes back to at least 2006  but in reality  it s probably much earlier than that  taking the long view of history and the audacious building  and rebuilding  of a euro centric empire in the middle east  one could say the process began the day the sykes picot agreement was signed in 1916  concealed between those post colonial lines drawn exactly 100 years ago  was the latent potential for the very conflicts and uncivil wars we are seeing today  if those borders are redrawn once again  you can be certain that they will be drawn by the very same powers involved a century ago  whatever the arrangement  it will be to weaken  not strengthen the region  and certainly not strengthen any of the present nation states in the region  especially syria  proprietary powers will want any new states to be stuck in a perpetual state of neocolonial dependency  with an emphasis on financial and security dependency mice and men21wire was one of the first news sources to warn about washington s initial impulse back in 2014 when it began calling for a  no fly zone  in northern syria  it was clear that a problem  reaction  solution dialectic was in play  with isis being the object of the public s reaction  that plan might have come to fruition in the fall of 2015  but a funny thing happened on the way to the un general assembly in new york city  later that week  russia announced that it would be inserting itself  and its air force  into the syrian quagmire  and with that  thwarted any master plan for a us turkey  nato  controlled no fly zone along the turkish syrian border  suffice to say  that russia already knew nato s next move and acted accordingly  and with purpose when asked two days ago about the prospect of the washington dc latest brainchild  train and equip 2 0  this time inside syria  here were my initial thoughts  we now know why  and it has more to do with what s beneath the sand than what s on top as any good pirate will tell you   if you want to claim your share of the booty  you have to do your share of the killing  the truth about  train and equip the previous  train and equip  program ended with washington s military brass paraded in front of the senate armed services committee  before being roundly lambasted for failing to train even a handful of  moderate rebels   this after being awarded  500 million by the us taxpayer to get er done  when originally announced amid much fanfare  the public were told that the us government  in conjunction with the cia  would be arming and training  moderate  militants in turkey  jordan or at a base in saudi arabia   before sending them to fight inside syria  washington claims that these new trainees were meant to fight isis  and not the syrian government forces  but judging by the unwavering  regime change  rhetoric from the west  it would be highly naive to think that all this was strictly for isis nine months into the train and equip project  us army gen  lloyd austin iii  acknowledged in sept  2015 that they had only managed to get  four or five  on the battlefield by then  not one member of the media challenged this statement  probably because most were happy with the answer given   one which gave any hawkish critics of the obama administration the pound of flesh they wanted and served to only intensify more calls before the new year for us  boots on the ground  in syria  doves loved it because it seemed to prove that backing proxies doesn t work  and that the best solution was to call it quits  for the sanguine mainstream media  it served up that all too familiar government narrative  of a  cock up  not a cover up   this is the media s natural default position  in other words   well  it didn t work out  but that s nothing new with our incompetent government  nothing to see here  move along   to ask how the money disappeared  or really inquire into how it costs  500 million to train only five men   apparently was way too much work for the media  not one  journalist  stopped to ask  if only 5 fighters were trained and dispatched  then what happened to the half a billion dollars the real answer to that question should be self evident to anyone studying reports on the ground in syria  and is way too uncomfortable for the us media to stomach   that the us  train and equip  program provided the necessary official cover to allow the prosecution of a dirty war under the table  it wasn t a failure like fall guy gen  lloyd austin will have you believe  it was a success judging by the proliferation of heavy weaponry and other lethal arms that have made it into the hands of al qaeda in syria  al nusra front   isis  jaysh al islam and others   it s clear that uncle sam s generous donation of  500 million has definitely been used to equip  if not train  those  rebels  in syria middle east commentator and analyst sharmine narwani explains the west s perennial dilemma when trying to identify who their  moderates  are in syria  for years  washington has insisted there are armed  moderate  groups in syria  but have gone to great lengths to avoid naming these  moderates   why  because if moderates were named and identified  the us would have to be very  very certain that no past  present or future  atrocity video  would surface to prove otherwise  and the us could not guarantee this with any of the groups they have armed  trained or financed in syria over the past five years  the next  train and equip  round will be more focused  and will be used to secure the following  the map above is from july 2015  but still represents the current military chessboard in syria safe zone    sunnistan somehow it feels like 1998 all over again  with bad memories of the kla in kosovo  imported jihadist fighters in bosnia  and nato lording over a newly balkanized region when you hear us officials like john mccain or clueless republican presidential candidates like marco rubio or carly fiorina  all crowing for a  safe zone  in northern syria  this is what they are referring to  see map above   their  safe zone  just so happens to be in the exact same area where isis is currently holding court  it s a  safe zone  alright  but not for refugees and  syrians fleeing the evil bashar al assad    rather  the  safe zone  will be for an array of  rebel  and terrorist fighters  part of a defacto sunni state lette in waiting so the us led coalition s  safe zone  is the very caliphate that americans are decrying for anyone requiring proof that such a grand chessboard is in play in syria  they need look no further than a set of us airstrikes that took place before christmas  on december 6  2015   us fighter bombers struck a syrian military base located in the village of ayyash in deir ezzor province  east of raqqa  which killed 3 syrian arab army  saa  soldiers and wounded additional others  naturally  the pentagon swiftly denied that any such attack took place  what happened after this incident was extremely telling  as explained by global affairs analyst mike whitney from counterpunch magazine  it s also worth noting  that according to south front military analysis  the us bombing raid coincided with a  a full scale isis offensive on the villages of ayyash and bgelia   in other words  the us attack provided sufficient air cover for isis terrorists to carry out their ground operations  was that part of the plan or was it merely a coincidence  so the us air force was coordinating with isis boots on the ground  to achieve a common military objective  but it didn t end there  less than 24 hours after the attack  us warplanes bombed the village of al khan in north eastern syria killing 26 syrian civilians including at least four women and seven children and four women  the message the us military is sending with these lethal attacks is that it wants to control the air space over east syria where it plans to remove isis and establish a de facto sunni state consistent with its scheme to break syria and iraq into smaller cantons governed by local warlords  islamic fanatics  and us puppets  also taking place at the same moment on dec 6th  was turkey s quiet little invasion into northern iraq  sending hundreds of troops and at least 20 tanks into territory north of mosul  right between the kurds and isis  it should be noted that this illegal incursion by nato member turkey was not approved by the iraqi government in baghdad  and iraqi pm haider al abadi called for turkey to  immediately withdraw its troops   judging by washington s silence on the matter  it s obvious that the us gave turkey its full blessing  here  zero hedge astutely points out the obvious  most importantly of all  right on what al araby al jadeed claims is the smuggling route for illegal isis crude into turkey from iraq   not surprisingly  turkey s sudden move also came at the same time that russia began to publicly expose turkey s clandestine role in facilitating the isis oil trade  as well as launching airstrikes to destroy isis oil convoys moving from syria into turkey  and then turkish leader recep tayyip erdo an  photo  left  places his military assets at the very location where stolen isis oil makes its way from iraq into turkey  hardly a coincidence make no mistake  both ends of nato s military axle  the united states and turkey  along with their saudi backed boots on the ground in isis and al nusra   have each made critical strategic moves in unison  and with a specific military purpose each time  nudging towards securing territory  once each key piece is finally in position  all that is required is a new  crisis   either in the region  or in europe  or in america   to allow the axis powers to move in quickly and take what is needed to implement the next phase of the game  whether that s creating a kurdish canton  or a sunni state lette  such moves will rarely be covered by the western international media to be perfectly clear  the terms  sunni  and  shia  are the favored sectarian lexicon used by nation builders inc and its international partners in riyadh and tel aviv  my intention here is not to reduce the muslim world down to this paradigm  but the architects of instability will use these terms  over and over   in their attempt to both marginalize and dehumanized muslims for their own selfish ends what s the  safe zone  for  as the us led coalition steps up its 18 month long punch  n judy air operation to supplant isis from raqqa  those western backed jihadis will later require a safe corridor to flee but still remain connected to their turkish supply lines  washington s  safe zone  would also provide a much needed safe haven for  rebels  who have been sent packing by the syrian government from towns like homs and others  as part of a painstaking disarming and reconciliation process between the assad government and  opposition  rebels who are willing to participate in the program  once the nato gcc axis has established a mini protectorate inside of syria  this will provide everything isis  al nusra  ahrar al sham  turkmens et all will need  a secure launching pad for incursions further inside syria   which will certainly guarantee a longer  protracted conflict in syria   and beyond this little sunni wedge is also conveniently located next to a large rebel terrorist contingent in syria s northwestern idlib governorate  province   syria s border with turkey has been porous from the beginning of the conflict  so the proposed  safe zone  will allow turkey to maintain this status quo   where it has been continuously allowing the free flow of weapons  rebels and terrorist fighters alike  along with oil  narcotics and human trafficking   to move freely through its southern border with syria if  regime  change  rhetoric is anything to go by  along with turning a blind eye to nato member turkey s role in facilitating supply lines and safe passage for al qaeda and isis  then washington s agenda is fairly transparent here  if they can establish a  internationally recognized  safe zone and a no fly zone on top of it  central planners believe they will have the platform they need to eventually destroy damascus  install their own western puppet  and then carve up syria and northern iraq accordingly  isis rat lines  black market oil has been a key component to carrying on both conflicts in syria  and iraq for the architects of instability in washington  one crucial benefit of carving out sunni territory in both northern and eastern syria is that available oil will help fund all of their paramilitary and terrorist needs   making it sustainable  to guarantee this uninterrupted income stream from black market oil which is presently making its way out of syria and into turkey and via kurdistan  help is required from the kurdish regional government  krg  and other stakeholders  including the british turkish firm genel energy  just one firm who is providing the end run to market for illicit isis oil  ditto for a key mover and shaker in raqqa s new rockefeller class  bilal erdogan  the son of turkish president  who according to numerous recent reports has already amassed a small fortune from the lucrative oil for terror trade this is a problem  but one which washington  london and paris are not overly concerned with  much less upset about  iraqi  kurdish and turkish opposition officials have accused turkish governments and the krg of deliberately allowing some of these smuggling operations to take place even as provisional state lettes and cantons are conjured around it  there is no guarantee that greater kurdistan will ever see the light of day if nation builders inc having anything to say bout it  the promise of greater kurdistan is as important to neocolonialists  than the reality of a greater kurdistan  turkey also has its own interests and ambitions  and a greater kurdistan is not compatible with them  iraq is not crazy about the idea either  because of obvious financial and energy resource reasons  so they remain in limb indefinitely  even as smaller quasi kurdish entities sprout up around the krg  turkey has its own ongoing  kurdish problem  within turkish borders  so ankara will naturally view any expressions of kurdish autonomy around it as a threat and potential inspiration for international kurdish solidarity  ruling over the kurds means keeping them divided  and playing them off against their neighbors there are those within the turkish establishment who believe there are old scores still unsettled   in reclaiming turk territory in both syria and iraq see also  special report  isis oil  follow the money  back to europe here is where sunnistan proper can emerge  coming into its own once set pieces are in place in iraq and across kurdistan  as mike whitney explained  so it looks like an agreement has been struck between turkey  the krg and the united states to seize parts of northern iraq and eastern syria to create a de facto sunni state that will be jointly controlled by ankara and washington   it also looks like obama has agreed to use dodgy jihadi proxies  aka terrorists  to work alongside us special forces to carry out future military operations   so while the effort to remove assad has been temporarily put on the backburner  the determination to destroy syria is as strong as ever   another dismembered part of old syria and iraq which central planners are hoping to hack off is an area called rojava  see map above   or  western kurdistan   this region in northern syria  formerly known as syrian kurdistan  gained its autonomy in november 2013 as part of the ongoing rojava revolution  the kurdish defense forces here are known as the ypg  people s defense units  and are not on friendly footing with neighboring turkey  for a number of reasons  not least of all because ypg defense forces present resistance to both al nusra and isis encroachments into all three rojava cantons  for turkey  this is bad for business  how rojava will factor into washington s plans is not clear yet  but it occupies the most strategic squares on the chessboard make no mistake  the history s actors are all in for this plan  do not be fooled by talk of  peace and stability  or humanitarian platitudes from western leaders  the un  or the fair weather international community another indication that these plans have the full backing of the neoconservative illiterati  and israel too  was pnac walrus and former us ambassador to the un john bolton s recent article in the establishment s daily journal of political posterity  the new york times  where he states  today s reality is that iraq and syria as we have known them are gone  the islamic state has carved out a new entity from the post ottoman empire settlement  mobilizing sunni opposition to the regime of president bashar al assad and the iran dominated government of iraq  also emerging  after years of effort  is a de facto independent kurdistan  central planners will happily frame this geopolitical scenario within the preferred theme of sunni vs shia  sectarian strife  in the region  which just happens to suit the interests and desires of both saudi arabia and israel  bolton confirms this  if  in this context  defeating the islamic state means restoring to power mr  assad in syria and iran s puppets in iraq  that outcome is neither feasible nor desirable  rather than striving to recreate the post world war i map  washington should recognize the new geopolitics  the best alternative to the islamic state in northeastern syria and western iraq is a new  independent sunni state  not so fast mr  ambassador  the islamic state is the sunni state so for all intents and purposes  he s calling for the establishment of the caliphate  funny how this goes right over the heads of  conservatives    this is just one of many geostrategic moves which will guarantee instability and military conflict in the region for another 100 years  as well as provide a timely entr e through to azerbaijan and into iran  and later towards the eurasian heartland of dagestan  russia s emerging energy center and geographic underbelly  in the meantime  expect to be pelted with endless propaganda about starving children in one town or another  changing week to week   with the usual slogans like   we must act now    and blaming bashar al assad for the suffering of his people  it s already wearing thin until the us and its nato gcc axis stops flooding syria and the region with weapons and terrorist fighters  and continues its policy of toppling secular nation states   then any attempt at holding peace talks will end up back at square one  and stand as another exercise in futility if the syrian conflict has been good for one thing  and that s not to say it has   it s that the scripted western narrative  in all of its variations  has finally hit the wall of truth

even after congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records  according to an annual report issued on tuesday by the top u s  intelligence officer  the report from the office of director of national intelligence dan coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 usa freedom act  which limited the nsa to collecting phone records and contacts of people u s  and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism  it found that the nsa collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016  in addition to a handful identified the previous year      the nsa has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone  metadata   records of callers  and recipients  phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls   but not their content   since the september 11  2001  attacks  the report came as congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  fisa   which permits the nsa to collect foreign intelligence information on non u s  persons outside the united states  and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year  privacy advocates have argued that section 702 permits the nsa to spy on internet and telephone communications of americans without warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court  and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements  the report said that on one occasion in 2016  the fbi obtained information about an american in response to a search of section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence   the report did not address how frequently the fbi obtained information about americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter  however  on friday  the nsa said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant      the new report also came amid allegations  recently repeated by u s  president donald trump  that former president barack obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser susan rice asked the nsa to unmask the names of u s  persons caught in the surveillance  both republican and democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation  officials on tuesday argued that the 151 million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former nsa contractor edward snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013  because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers  the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller  the officials said  they said they had no breakdown of how many individuals  phone records were among those collected   in all  according to the report  u s  officials unmasked the names of fewer americans in nsa eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year  the top u s  intelligence officer reported on tuesday  the report said the names of 1 934  u s  persons  were  unmasked  last year in response to specific requests  compared with 2 232 in 2015  but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds  officials said in the report that u s  intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about u s  electronic eavesdropping   this year s report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency  providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law   said office of the director of national intelligence spokesman timothy barrett  \",\n          \"washington  reuters    banks  credit card issuers and other financial companies will be able to block customers from banding together to sue over disputes  after the u s  senate on tuesday narrowly killed a rule banning the firms from using  forced arbitration  clauses  republican vice president mike pence appeared on the senate floor at 10 11 p m  edt  0211 gmt  to cast the tie breaking vote as the chamber s president and approve the most significant roll back of obama era financial policy since president donald trump took office vowing to loosen the leash on wall street  the final count was 51 to 50    the republican dominated house of representatives has already passed the resolution repealing the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb  rule released in july  the resolution also bars regulators from instituting a similar ban in the future  after a signature from trump  expected soon  the resolution will abruptly end a years long fight that has included multiple federal regulators  consumer advocacy groups  and financial lobbyists  cfpb director richard cordray  a democrat appointed by former president barack obama  rarely comments on congressional action but on tuesday night said  wall street won and ordinary people lost     this vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company   he added  customers must agree to the clauses as a condition of opening accounts  saying they will take any disputes to closed door arbitration instead of joining class action lawsuits  where complainants band together to share litigation costs  the clauses are used for nearly every u s  consumer product and service since the supreme court ruled them legal in 2011   victims of the equifax inc   efx n  hack were outraged last month when the company included forced arbitration fine print in offering them free credit monitoring  the company later removed the clauses  at the same time  wells fargo   co  wfc n  customers whose identities were used in last year s phony accounts scandal have had difficulty suing the bank because they are bound by arbitration clauses in contracts they signed for legitimate accounts  the cfpb rule  set to go into effect next spring  was not retroactive and would not have helped equifax or wells customers  members of trump s administration have relentlessly assailed the regulation  and on monday the treasury department laid out arguments against it in a special report  acting comptroller of the currency keith norieka said on tuesday the senate s action stopped a rule  that would have likely increased the cost of credit for hardworking americans and made it more difficult for small community banks to resolve differences with their customers   meanwhile  major bank lobbying groups who sued last month to block the rule cheered the resolution s passage   one of the groups  the u s  chamber of commerce  said congress had reined in the  overgrown and unaccountable  cfpb  an independent agency created to protect individuals  finances that conservatives say consistently reaches beyond its authority in its rulemaking  critics of the rule had said class actions only benefit trial lawyers and arbitration generally wins larger settlement awards for customers  supporters said forced arbitration harms customers by putting companies in control of the process and taking away the right to sue enshrined in the u s  constitution   the cfpb created its rule after conducting a five year study that found customers struggle to have banks open arbitration cases about their complaints  but that those few cases have led to slightly higher individual awards than class actions    the senate today prevented a cash grab that would have transferred wealth from consumers to the pockets of wealthy attorneys   said ted frank  director of the center for class action fairness at the free market group competitive enterprise institute  ohio senator sherrod brown  the most senior democrat on the banking committee  meanwhile  said tuesday s vote  will make the rich richer  and the powerful more powerful    \",\n          \"the popular christian author eric metaxas really puts things in perspective when he explains why sitting home in this election is not an option this question should hardly require an essay  but let s face it  we re living in strange times  america is in trouble over this past year many of donald trump s comments have made me almost literally hopping mad  the hot mic comments from 2005 are especially horrifying  can there be any question we should denounce them with flailing arms and screeching volume  i must not hang out in the right locker rooms  because if anyone i know said such things i might assault him physically  and repent later   so yes  many see these comments as a deal breaker but we have a very knotty and larger problem  what if the other candidate also has deal breakers  even a whole deplorable basketful  suddenly things become horribly awkward  would god want me simply not to vote  is that a serious option what if not pulling the lever for mr  trump effectively means electing someone who has actively enabled sexual predation in her husband before and while he was president  won t god hold me responsible for that  what if she defended a man who raped a 12 year old and in recalling the case laughed about getting away with it  will i be excused from letting this person become president  what if she used her position as secretary of state to funnel hundreds of millions into her own foundation  much of it from nations that treat women and gay people worse than dogs  since these things are true  can i escape responsibility for them by simply not voting many say they won t vote because choosing the lesser of two evils is still choosing evil  but this is sophistry  neither candidate is pure evil  they are human beings  we cannot escape the uncomfortable obligation to soberly choose between them  not voting or voting for a third candidate who cannot win is a rationalization designed more than anything to assuage our consciences  yet people in america and abroad depend on voters to make this very difficult choice children in the middle east are forced to watch their fathers drowned in cages by isis  kids in inner city america are condemned to lives of poverty  hopelessness and increasing violence  shall we sit on our hands and simply trust  the least of these  to god  as though that were our only option  don t we have an obligation to them for many of us  this is very painful  pulling the lever for someone many think odious  but please consider this  a vote for donald trump is not necessarily a vote for donald trump himself  it is a vote for those who will be affected by the
